## About the Book
In today’s fast-paced software development landscape, ensuring application quality requires a strategic approach to test automation. Mastering Design Patterns for Layered Testing empowers you with the knowledge and tools to design, implement, and optimize automation across UI, API, and backend layers using Python’s powerful ecosystem.

Starting with foundational concepts like test design patterns and the Test Pyramid, the book delves into practical implementations of unit testing, integration testing, API testing, and contract testing. You’ll learn how to integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, generate detailed test reports with Allure, and address modern testing challenges such as microservices and containerized environments. Real-world case studies illustrate how to apply these techniques in production settings.

A dedicated chapter on Generative AI in testing explores its applications in test case generation and test data creation. Whether you're an intermediate tester looking to enhance your automation skills or an experienced professional seeking to learn advanced strategies, this book provides the expertise needed to build scalable and reliable test automation frameworks that drive software quality and efficiency. Stay ahead of the curve—master next-gen test automation before it’s too late!
